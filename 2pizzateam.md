##Two Pizza Team  
The term "Two pizza team" comes from Amazon and describes a team size such that it is the number of people that can be fed by two pizza. The reality is that the term is not a reference to team size but, rather, underscores the concept of "Accountability". In the world of Cloud Native Computing, a small team is responsible for 100 percent of an application and its life, from inception to coding to support. In  traditional (e.g. waterfall) SDLC schemes, teams are built around the division of responsibilties: Design, development, testing, database, operations, etc. In the microservices model, teams are built around a function or unit of work: Adding to inventory, retrieving a list nearby stores, etc. This typically small team is free to design, develop, test and deploy the microservice as it sees fit. Language choice (Java, C#, Go?) is not governed by an outside management force, but it determined by the teams skillset or a particular language's best fit for a function. The design is determined by the team; any local database is their choice, as it is deployed with the solution. Testing remains their challenge as well, with a built-in incentive: The team also supports the application, so fewer defects means less time spent in support. On the other hand, a problem at 3AM on a Saturday is the team's responsibility and their's alone.
