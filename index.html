    <div class="page-heading">Compass: The Red Hat Architectural Guide To Building Cloud Native Software</div>
    <div class="section-heading">Why This Guide?</div>
<p>Software development is no longer an isolated function. As cloud computing because ubiquitous and commodicized, and as systems and teams are becoming more frequently distributed, it becomes crucial that vendor and software selections not only work well, but that they work well together.</p>
<p>Understanding this, Red Hat has put together this web site in order to help developers down the past of both least resistance and greatest value toward software success.  </p>
<p>Embracing open source as more than software --  but rather as a culture -- means this guide is an ongoing effort and subject to changes, improvement and additions as merited.  </p>
<p>The Red Hat way of development in centered around the concept of "cloud computing", and is not limited to any one language. While the programming languages used in this guide are limited (Java for now; node, Go, Python and C# later), the concepts are not. Any developer of any language discipline can profit from this site.</p>
